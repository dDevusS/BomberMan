# BomberMan

### About
It's a classic game Minesweeper with console interface created by me.
You have to open all cell without bombs for winning. If you open cell with bomb you lose the game immediately.
The number on the all visible cells shows how many bombs are near to this cell.
You can make your turn to type special command for opening cells or marking.
Your command shoul be like "open 3-5" or "bomb 4-7" where first word is specific command, 
and second numbers is coordinate of cell that you want to open or mark.
You can see legend on left from field for remembering this commands.
If you want to exit from the game, don't worry, all your progress will be saved.
